# RunTron

## The Game

 *RunTron* is a web-based game. To win, run and try to cover as much area as possible within the given time. 

## How to Play
 
Open the link from a mobile device. When you are ready to begin, tap on the start button and then run!

You may end the game at any point before the time runs out. How much area you are able to cover will be your final score. Be one of the top 8 and your score will be displayed on the leaderboard.

*This project was built as a collaborative effort with Mason [Mason Terry](https://github.com/masonjterry) and [Chris Pratt](https://github.com/kered5) for the UT Coding Bootcamp. It is still in development as we polish the code and work towards more efficient syntax*
